This is a port of Steve Sanderson's [Pizza Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop) for Blazor
by using F# and Bolero. It also shows an example on How to do CQRS with Event Sourcing using Akka Cluster Sharding. (See how orders are placed on server side)

* Live version working with Server-side blazor is here: https://fblazorshopfast.azurewebsites.net/
* Live version working with WASM is here: https://fblazorshopwasm.azurewebsites.net/

- Requires .NET Core 3.1 SDK
- Just start the FBlazorShop.Web project

By default the application runs on Server-side mode. If you want Web Assembly, just add WASM compilation constant to the FBlazorShop.Web project and rebuild.
