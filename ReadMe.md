This is a port of Steve Sanderson's [Pizza Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop) for Blazor
by using F# and Bolero.

- Requires .NET Core 3.1 SDK
- Just start the the Web project

By default it runs on Server-side mode. If you want Web Assembly just add WASM, compilation constant to the FBlazorShop.Web project and rebuild.
